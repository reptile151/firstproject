<div id="what is a viper"><head><h1>What is a Viper</h1></head>

<p><h2>A viper is any species of snake that is a member of the Viperidae family.
they have Two long, hollow fangs for injecting venom they are located at the back of the upper jaw below the eyes. their upper jaw muscles are extremely flexible wicht allows them to move their fangs independently. These fangs are folded against the roof of the mouth when not in use.
Vipers have the ability to deliver “dry bites” and carefully control how much venom is used per bite, this allows them to conserve venom and use what is needed for situations like self-defense and catching small prey. Keeled scales, or ridged scales that splay slightly outward from the body, giving the snake’s skin a rough, textured appearance but not present in all vipers
most all vipers are ovoviviparous, where a snake’s young hatch from their eggs while still inside the mothers body the mother snake then gives birth to about 50 to 60 live babies at a time and expels the remains of the eggs but not all vipers are ovovivparous.</h2></p>

<div id="Types of Vipers"><head><h1>Types of Vipers</h1></head>



<p><h2>Crotalinae, known collectively as pit vipers have 150 species. Pit viper have heat-sensing  pits located on either side of the snake’s head, these small pits are usually clearly visible between the nostrils and eyes of the snake.

<div id="Habitats and lives"><head><h1>Habitats and lives</h1></head>

<p><h2>Because there are so many different species of viper it’s safe to say that they can be found all over the world with the exceptions of some remote places like, Antarctica, Australia(surprising I know), New Zealand, Madagascar, and North of the Article Circle as well as many island clusters like Hawaii. Some more specific habitats including deserts, forests and rain forests, plains and prairies, and some lower mountains and near bodies of water. all vipers are ambush predators witch means they sit and wait for there pray to come within striking distends then strike within the blink of an eye and ingect venom to kill their pray. The exact age of vipers in the wild is not none but in captivity they can live anywhere from 20 to 50 years.</h2></p>
